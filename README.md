I chose to go with a very simple design so that kids just starting to learn how to do maths can understand it but not so simple so that older people can't use it. 
this calculator was designed mainly for younger kids who are just learning how to use a calculator
I chose not to use a decimal because it could confuse some of the yuonger people who use it and might complicate it to much.

the calculator has add, subtract, multiply and divide so that everyone can use it.

I used the color green to make it look more colourful and different.
I made the buttons big and spaced out enough so that users don't accidentally click the wrong button.
